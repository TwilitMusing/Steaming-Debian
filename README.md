# Steaming-Debian
Solutions for troubleshooting gaming on Debian distributions.

This is an archiving of, something that a few would describe as, an unfortunate case of a game developer's haste when pushing uploads for their respective products. Within the domain of "indie" games, an experience to which, definitely, some would say that they have experienced at some point in their lives, you get a competitive environment in which very small developmental teams rush to provide content for their clientele. Sometimes, games entirely break from their intended functionality, and unnecessary confusion and despair emanate from those who exhibit a particular bonding to a piece of digital information, for which they have invested a particular amount of time and/or finance. For those without the savvy necessary to navigate through such times without suffering significant impair, I provide herein options otherwise not found on their respective platforms.

As a side note, the majority of solutions documented pertain to implementations within a Debian architecture.
